# Coordinate-transformation-method-C-method-for-overhanging-gratings
This freeware is an implementation of the coordinate transformation method for overhanging gratings, which is based on simple change of variables without any tensor concept, thus it may be more friendly to primary users.

Most of the guidance is included in the code as comments, and a detailed standalone manual is coming soon. If you have any problem in using this freeware, please contact me by mxsin2007@163.com with no hesitate.
