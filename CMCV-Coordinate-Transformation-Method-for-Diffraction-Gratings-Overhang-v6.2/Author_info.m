Matlab implementation of the Coordinate Transformation Method (Chandezon Method,C method) given in
X. Ming et al., 2021, title "Simple reformulation of the coordinate transformation method for gratings with a vertical facet or overhanging profile".
This is a free software with part of the initial source code for ordinary C method written by Nikolay Komarevskiy and Josef Navratil
seperately from GitHub, and is assembled and modified by Xianshun Ming with new functions specially for overhang gratings.
We may call this freeware CMCV-overhang: Coordinate Transformation Method by Change of Variables for overhang gratings.
