Matlab implementation of the Coordinate Transformation Method (Chandezon Method,C method) given in
L. Li et al., 1999, title "Rigorous and efficient grating-analysis method made easy for optical engineers".
This is a free software with part of the initial source code written by Nikolay Komarevskiy and Josef Navratil
seperately from GitHub, and assembled and modified by Xianshun Ming with new function specially for overhang gratings.
We may call this freeware CMCV-overhang: Coordinate Transformation Method by Change of Variables for overhang gratings.
